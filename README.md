# Portfolio Project

## Overview
* This is a portfolio website to showcase all of the projects that I have done in this course and also to use this when the course is over to show to my prospective employers so that they will be able to see what I am capable of doing. 
* The website is a responsive react based application, it is also mobile friendly,  and the contents of the website will adjust accordingly depending on whether it is being viewed on a computer screen or on a mobile screen. 

## Challenges
* Learning how to use Tailwind CSS in order to create the website. 
* Figuring out how to decide on the layout of the website so that it brings attention to my skills as a developer.


## Technology in Use
* React and Tailwind CSS

## Notes For the Future
* Continue to update the website in the future as I work on more projects to showcase for potential employers.
